There's a famous quote from some architect: "form follows function"
It means, when you are designing something, you start with the function "what the will do", and starting from there you design the form.
For content websites, we can translate it to: "presentation follows content". It means that you start with the content, the thing you want to communicate, and from there you define the right presentation.
