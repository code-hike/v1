Let's start with a quiz.

We have two screenshots, which one do you think is from a website with all the navigation removed, and which one is from the page of a book, a physical book?

I'll reveal the answer in 5 seconds.

They are both from websites.

But to be fair they could be also from books.

# !! screenshots

import { Carrousel, LittleBoxes } from "./carrousel"

<LittleBoxes />

<Carrousel />

## !note

These are all screenshots of technical content websites, the main content area of the website.

This is a random sample of blogs, tutorials, documentation.

They are from different ecosystems, using different technologies. Each of these explain a different concept.

And they all look just the same.
They all use the same static one-column layout. Same layout as most books.

There's this principle in architecture and industrual design that says: form follows function.

It means, I think, that the shape of a building or a product should be defined by its function. You start with the function, and then you design the form.

If we apply this to content websites, we can say that: presentation follows content.

we start with the content, the thing we want to communicate
and then we think about how to present it
different content may benefit from different presentation

let me show you some examples where this principle was applied
