These are all screenshots of technical content websites, with the navigation removed, so only the content stays.

A random sample of blogs, tutorials, documentation.

They are from different ecosystems, using different technologies. Each of these explain a different concept.

And they all look just the same.
They all use the same static one-column layout.

There's this principle in architecture and industrual design that says: form follows function.

It means, I think, that the shape of a building or a product should be defined by its function. You start with the function, and then you design the form.

Isf we apply this to content websites, we can say that: presentation follows content.

we start with the content, the thing we want to communicate
and then we think about how to present it
different content may benefit from different presentation

let me show you some examples where this principle was applied
