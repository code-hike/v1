Let's start with a quiz.

We have two screenshots, which one do you think is from a website with all the navigation removed, and which one is from the page of a book, a physical book?

I'll reveal the answer in 5 seconds.

They are both from websites.

But to be fair they could be also from books.

# !! screenshots

import { Carrousel, LittleBoxes } from "./carrousel"

<LittleBoxes />

<Carrousel />

## !note

These are all screenshots of technical content websites, we are only showing the main content area of each website.

And this is a random sample of blogs, tutorials, documentation.

They are from **different** ecosystems, using **different** technologies. Each of these explain a **different** concept.

Yet, they all look the **same**. They all use the same static one-column layout. Same layout as most books.

There's nothing wrong either with books or with this layout. But this doesn't mean that this is **always** the best choice.

There's this principle in architecture that says: form follows function. It means, I think, that the shape of a building should be defined by its function. You start with the function, and then you design the form.

If we apply this to content websites, we can say that: presentation follows content. We start with the content, the thing we want to communicate, and then we think about how to present it. Different content may benefit from different presentations.

Another principle I have is "use the medium". For example, if you create videos, you wouldn't make a video that emulates a book, you will take advantage of the video format to comunicate the content. In the same way, if you are building a content website, you should take advantage of the special features that the web provides.

Let me show you some examples that follow these principles...
