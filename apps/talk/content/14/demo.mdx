```

```tsx !page r
export default function Conf() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>JSHeroes 2024</h1>
    </main>
  )
}
```

## !note

So let's say we want to create the JSHeroes website.

# !! schema

```tsx !page r
import { Block, ImageBlock, parseRoot } from "codehike/blocks"

const Schema = Block.extend({
  speakers: z.array(
    Block.extend({
      pic: ImageBlock,
      time: z.string(),
      talk: Block,
    }),
  ),
})

export default function Conf() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>JSHeroes 2024</h1>
    </main>
  )
}
```

## !note

We start with the schema of the content.

In this case is an array of speakers, each with a picture, time, and talk.

# !! import

```tsx !page r
import { Block, ImageBlock, parseRoot } from "codehike/blocks"

const Schema = Block.extend({
  speakers: z.array(
    Block.extend({
      pic: ImageBlock,
      time: z.string(),
      talk: Block,
    }),
  ),
})

import Content from "./speakers.md"
const { speakers } = parseRoot(Content, Schema)

export default function Conf() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>JSHeroes 2024</h1>
    </main>
  )
}
```

## !note

Now we can use this `parseRoot` function to extract the speakers array from the markdown file.

# !! speaker section

```tsx !page r
const { speakers } = parseRoot(Content, Schema)

export default function Conf() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>JSHeroes 2024</h1>
      <h2>Speakers</h2>
      <section>
        {speakers.map((speaker) => (
          <div>
            <img src={speaker.pic.url} alt={speaker.pic.alt} />
            <h3>{speaker.title}</h3>
          </div>
        ))}
      </section>
    </main>
  )
}
```

## !note

And now that we have the speakers in the shape we want, we can for example render the speakers section, with picture and name of each speaker.

Here it uses `speaker.title` but it would make more sense to have `speaker.name`, title is the default name for the content of the header of the block. Maybe I can show you later how to change it.

# !! agenda section

```tsx !page r
export default function Conf() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>JSHeroes 2024</h1>
      <h2>Speakers</h2>
      <section>
        {speakers.map((speaker) => (
          <div>
            <img src={speaker.pic.url} alt={speaker.pic.alt} />
            <h3>{speaker.title}</h3>
          </div>
        ))}
      </section>
      <h2>Agenda</h2>
      <section>
        {speakers.map((speaker) => (
          <div>
            <span>{speaker.time}</span>
            <img src={speaker.pic.url} alt={speaker.pic.alt} />
            <span>
              <h3>{speaker.title}</h3>
              {speaker.talk.title}
            </span>
          </div>
        ))}
      </section>
    </main>
  )
}
```

## !note

We also want agenda section, with time, picture, title of the talk.

# !! classNames

```tsx !page r
export default function Conf() {
  return (
    <main className="max-w-md mx-auto">
      <h1 className="text-center text-5xl py-4">JSHeroes 2024</h1>
      <h2 className="text-2xl py-4">Speakers</h2>
      <section className="flex flex-wrap gap-4 pb-4 justify-between">
        {speakers.map((speaker) => (
          <div className="w-32">
            <img
              src={speaker.pic.url}
              alt={speaker.pic.alt}
              className="rounded-full h-32"
            />
            <h3 className="text-center pt-2">{speaker.title}</h3>
          </div>
        ))}
      </section>
      <h2 className="text-2xl py-4">Agenda</h2>
      <section className="pb-4">
        {speakers.map((speaker) => (
          <div
            className="flex items-center gap-4 py-2 text-left w-full"
            speaker={speaker}
          >
            <span className="w-12 font-mono">{speaker.time}</span>
            <img
              src={speaker.pic.url}
              alt={speaker.pic.alt}
              className="grayscale h-20 w-20 rounded-full"
            />
            <span className="flex-1">
              <h3 className="font-bold">{speaker.title}</h3>
              {speaker.talk.title}
            </span>
          </div>
        ))}
      </section>
    </main>
  )
}
```

## !note

Now we magically add a lot of tailwind classes to make it look good.

# !! demo

```md !content ll

```

```tsx !page l
export default function Conf() {
  return (
    <main className="max-w-md mx-auto">
      <h1 className="text-center text-5xl py-4">JSHeroes 2024</h1>
      <h2 className="text-2xl py-4">Speakers</h2>
      <section className="flex flex-wrap gap-4 pb-4 justify-between">
        {speakers.map((speaker) => (
          <div className="w-32">
            <img
              src={speaker.pic.url}
              alt={speaker.pic.alt}
              className="rounded-full h-32"
            />
            <h3 className="text-center pt-2">{speaker.title}</h3>
          </div>
        ))}
      </section>
      <h2 className="text-2xl py-4">Agenda</h2>
      <section className="pb-4">
        {speakers.map((speaker) => (
          <div
            className="flex items-center gap-4 py-2 text-left w-full"
            speaker={speaker}
          >
            <span className="w-12 font-mono">{speaker.time}</span>
            <img
              src={speaker.pic.url}
              alt={speaker.pic.alt}
              className="grayscale h-20 w-20 rounded-full"
            />
            <span className="flex-1">
              <h3 className="font-bold">{speaker.title}</h3>
              {speaker.talk.title}
            </span>
          </div>
        ))}
      </section>
    </main>
  )
}
```

!demo r

## !note codesandbox

And I have all this in this codesandbox.

https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/jsheroes-2024-grn3jr?file=%2Fapp%2Fcontent.md

And this is how it looks.

# !! dialog

## !note

Here I also have a dialog trigger that we can use to show the speaker details.

And we can do the same in the agenda section.

# !! schema

## !note

Here we have the schema, we should see all the right types for the speaker arrays.

And also, if I go to the content and let's say I remove the picture from Eva. we should see an error, and it says that in the block of Eva Ferreira the picture is missing.

# !! blocks navigation

## !note

Another cool thing, since we are using markdown headers for the blocks, we can take advantage of a lot of existing tooling.

for example

- we can fold the blocks,
- we can use the outline to navigate the content
- we can even use this thing, the breadcrumbs,

That's the demo.

# !! codeblocks

## !note

There's also some codeblock specific features that I don’t have time to cover in detail, but let me show you some quick examples.

We can have annotations inside codeblocks, and the we can define custom component to handle those annotations.

So the annotations are comments inside the codeblock, and here for example we use a regular expression to match part of the next line, and then we have a specific component that handles this annotation and renders this thing.

And this are custom components, they are not part of codehike. But of course, this examples are copypastable, so you can go to the implementation and copy the component.

# !! codeblocks 2

## !note

Here's another one, we are using a range instead of a regex.

We have more stuff

This one I use a lot, it has a more complex regex, that matches all the classNames so we can hide them until clicked. Very useful if your examples use tailwind.

This one is interesting, because we are using a component that has blocks, and then from inside the codeblock we use those blocks and show them as tooltips.

# !! codeblocks and rsc

## !note

This one with typescript is also interesting.

If we go to the implementation, we see that we are taking the code from the codeblock and running the typescript compiler, **inside the component**. And then after that we also run syntax highlighting.

This is because, if you use a framework that supports react server components, every component that we saw, by default is a server component, and server here means build server, so any code we put there is resolved at build time. And that allows some really cool use cases.

Ok, back to the slides.

# !! code hike v1

## !note

Code Hike v1, currently in alpha, there's a beta version coming really soon. and I expect to have a stable version in the following weeks.

That's the docs if you want to check it out.

That's my twitter if you want to stay updated.

# !! recap

- Presentation follows content
- Use the medium
- We have the tools

## !note

So, to wrap up.

Next time you're building a content website, instead of defaulting to the same static layout, find something that fits the content you are trying to communicate. Use the medium. If you are building for the web, use the power of the modern web. It may be harder than the default static layout, but we have the tools and we have the talent.

Let's make the web better JSHeroes.

Thank you.
