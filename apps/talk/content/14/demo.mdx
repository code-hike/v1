```

```tsx !page r
export default function Conf() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>JSHeroes 2024</h1>
    </main>
  )
}
```

## !note

So let's say we want to create the JSHeroes website.

# !! schema

```tsx !page r
import { Block, ImageBlock, parseRoot } from "codehike/blocks"

const Schema = Block.extend({
  speakers: z.array(
    Block.extend({
      pic: ImageBlock,
      time: z.string(),
      talk: Block,
    }),
  ),
})

export default function Conf() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>JSHeroes 2024</h1>
    </main>
  )
}
```

## !note

We start with the schema of the content.

In this case is an array of speakers, each with a picture, time, and talk.

# !! import

```tsx !page r
import { Block, ImageBlock, parseRoot } from "codehike/blocks"

const Schema = Block.extend({
  speakers: z.array(
    Block.extend({
      pic: ImageBlock,
      time: z.string(),
      talk: Block,
    }),
  ),
})

import Content from "./speakers.md"
const { speakers } = parseRoot(Content, Schema)

export default function Conf() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>JSHeroes 2024</h1>
    </main>
  )
}
```

## !note

Now we can use this `parseRoot` function to extract the speakers array from the markdown file.

# !! speaker section

```tsx !page r
const { speakers } = parseRoot(Content, Schema)

export default function Conf() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>JSHeroes 2024</h1>
      <h2>Speakers</h2>
      <section>
        {speakers.map((speaker) => (
          <div>
            <img src={speaker.pic.url} alt={speaker.pic.alt} />
            <h3>{speaker.title}</h3>
          </div>
        ))}
      </section>
    </main>
  )
}
```

## !note

And now that we have the speakers in the shape we want, we can for example render the speakers section, with picture and name of each speaker.

Here it uses `speaker.title` but it would make more sense to have `speaker.name`, title is the default name for the content of the header of the block. Maybe I can show you later how to change it.

# !! agenda section

```tsx !page r
export default function Conf() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>JSHeroes 2024</h1>
      <h2>Speakers</h2>
      <section>
        {speakers.map((speaker) => (
          <div>
            <img src={speaker.pic.url} alt={speaker.pic.alt} />
            <h3>{speaker.title}</h3>
          </div>
        ))}
      </section>
      <h2>Agenda</h2>
      <section>
        {speakers.map((speaker) => (
          <div>
            <span>{speaker.time}</span>
            <img src={speaker.pic.url} alt={speaker.pic.alt} />
            <span>
              <h3>{speaker.title}</h3>
              {speaker.talk.title}
            </span>
          </div>
        ))}
      </section>
    </main>
  )
}
```

## !note

We also want agenda section, with time, picture, title of the talk.

# !! classNames

```tsx !page r
export default function Conf() {
  return (
    <main className="max-w-md mx-auto">
      <h1 className="text-center text-5xl py-4">JSHeroes 2024</h1>
      <h2 className="text-2xl py-4">Speakers</h2>
      <section className="flex flex-wrap gap-4 pb-4 justify-between">
        {speakers.map((speaker) => (
          <div className="w-32">
            <img
              src={speaker.pic.url}
              alt={speaker.pic.alt}
              className="rounded-full h-32"
            />
            <h3 className="text-center pt-2">{speaker.title}</h3>
          </div>
        ))}
      </section>
      <h2 className="text-2xl py-4">Agenda</h2>
      <section className="pb-4">
        {speakers.map((speaker) => (
          <div
            className="flex items-center gap-4 py-2 text-left w-full"
            speaker={speaker}
          >
            <span className="w-12 font-mono">{speaker.time}</span>
            <img
              src={speaker.pic.url}
              alt={speaker.pic.alt}
              className="grayscale h-20 w-20 rounded-full"
            />
            <span className="flex-1">
              <h3 className="font-bold">{speaker.title}</h3>
              {speaker.talk.title}
            </span>
          </div>
        ))}
      </section>
    </main>
  )
}
```

## !note

Now we magically add a lot of tailwind classes.

# !! demo

```md !content ll

```

```tsx !page l
export default function Conf() {
  return (
    <main className="max-w-md mx-auto">
      <h1 className="text-center text-5xl py-4">JSHeroes 2024</h1>
      <h2 className="text-2xl py-4">Speakers</h2>
      <section className="flex flex-wrap gap-4 pb-4 justify-between">
        {speakers.map((speaker) => (
          <div className="w-32">
            <img
              src={speaker.pic.url}
              alt={speaker.pic.alt}
              className="rounded-full h-32"
            />
            <h3 className="text-center pt-2">{speaker.title}</h3>
          </div>
        ))}
      </section>
      <h2 className="text-2xl py-4">Agenda</h2>
      <section className="pb-4">
        {speakers.map((speaker) => (
          <div
            className="flex items-center gap-4 py-2 text-left w-full"
            speaker={speaker}
          >
            <span className="w-12 font-mono">{speaker.time}</span>
            <img
              src={speaker.pic.url}
              alt={speaker.pic.alt}
              className="grayscale h-20 w-20 rounded-full"
            />
            <span className="flex-1">
              <h3 className="font-bold">{speaker.title}</h3>
              {speaker.talk.title}
            </span>
          </div>
        ))}
      </section>
    </main>
  )
}
```

!demo r

## !note codesandbox

And I have all this in this codesandbox.

https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/jsheroes-2024-grn3jr?file=%2Fapp%2Fcontent.md

And this is how it looks.

# !! dialog

## !note

here I also have a dialog trigger that we can use to show the speaker details.

and we can do the same in the agenda section.

# !! schema

## !note

here we have the schema, and we have all the right types for the speaker arrays.

and also, if I go to the content and let's say I remove the picture from Eva. we should see an error, and it says that in the block of Eva Ferreira the picture is missing.

# !! blocks navigation

## !note

another cool thing, since we are using markdown headers for the blocks, we can take advantage of a lot of existing tooling.

for example

- we can fold the blocks,
- we can use the outline to navigate the content
- we can even use this thing, the breadcrumbs,

that's the demo,

# !! codeblocks

## !note

there's also that we can do with codeblocks that I dont have to much time to show in detail, but I can show you some examples really quick

for codeblocks we also have this idea applying annotations to take a part of the codeblock using our own components to render it.

so in codeblocks the annotations are comments, and here for example we use a regular expression to match part of the next line, and then we have a specific component that handles this annotation and renders this thing.

and this are custom components, they are not part of codehike. of course, this examples are copypastable, so you can go to the implementation and copy the component

# !! codeblocks 2

## !note

here's another example, here we are using a range of lines, and the component here collapse or expand these four lines.

we have more stuff

this one I use a lot, it has a more complex regex, it matches all the classNames and fold them by default, and then when we click they expand

this one is interesting, because we are using a component with blocks as we saw before, to define the content of some tooltips, and then we use them from inside the codeblock to show them as tooltips.

# !! codeblocks and rsc

## !note

this one with typescript is also different.

if we go to the implementation, we see that we are taking the code from the codeblock and running the typescript compiler, inside the component. and then after that we also run syntax highlighting.

this is because, if you use a framework that supports react server components, every component that we saw by default is a server component, and server here means build server, so any code we put there is resolved at build time. and that allows some really cool use cases.

ok, back to the slides.

# !! code hike v1

## !note

Code Hike v1, currently in alpha, there's a beta version coming really soon. and i expect to have a stable version in the following weeks.

that's the docs if you want to check it out.

# !! recap

## !note

so, recap.

- most technical content websites use the same static one-column layout
- but there's a small minority building content websites with layouts that
  - are better for the content
  - take advantage of the medium

if we put that into a chart it would look like this [chart]

- so we want more websites in this space, but building them is harder
- I showed what I think is the main pain point, the gap between markdown and UI components
- and we've seen how Code Hike can help with that

So I hope I convinced at least some of you to explore more ways of presenting content on the web.

Thank you.
