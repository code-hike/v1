- not saying that the one-column layout is bad, it has many advantages, and most of the time it's the best choice
- one advantage is familiarity, is actually the same layout that we use for books or even scrolls
- familiarity is good for new mediums, skeuomorphism, like video games, or tv
- but when the medium is mature, like the web, we need to explore new possibilities and innovate to take advantage of the medium
