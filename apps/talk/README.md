- the great majority of content websites use the same one-column static layout
- sometimes there are better ways to present the content

- not saying that the one-column layout is bad, it has many advantages, and most of the time it's the best choice
- one advantage is familiarity, is actually the same layout that we use for books or even scrolls
- familiarity is good for new mediums, skeuomorphism, like video games, or tv
- but when the medium is mature, like the web, we need to explore new possibilities and innovate to take advantage of the medium

- but custom layouts are hard to implement
- we want to use markdown to write the content
- and markdown renders to one-column static layout
- so we need tools to help us create different layouts from markdown

- the layouts themselves are not that difficult to do with something like React
- but to use React we need the content in the right shape
- and we want to use markdown to write the content because it's minimalistic
- so we need a way to transform markdown into the right shape for React

- here I present the tool I've created for this purpose
- show some demos

- end with:
  - presentation follows content
  - use the medium (take advantage of the web)
  - content belongs in markdown
  - mind the gap (between markdown and the web)
