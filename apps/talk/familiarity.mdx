Advantages of the static one-column layout:

- familiarity
- easy to build

## !note

- not saying that the one-column layout is bad, it has many advantages, and most of the time it's the best choice
- one advantage is familiarity, is actually the same layout that we use for books or even scrolls
- familiarity is good for new mediums, skeuomorphism, like video games, or tv
- but when the medium is mature, like the web, we need to explore new possibilities and innovate to take advantage of the medium

- the other advantage is it's easier to build

Familiarity

books/scrolls =skeuomorphism=> one-column layout websites =innovation=> other layouts

horse cart =skeuomorphism=> carriage =innovation=> modern cars

## !note

now, with familiarity I mean when a user visit your website, they immediately understand how to consume the content, because it's the same thing they are used to. And not only from other websites, but from other mediums, it's the same layout that we use for books or even literally scrolls.
